  * `-v` `--verbose` = Show more details to stdout.
  * `--force-arch=<ARCH>` = Simulate an architecture.
    * `i386` or `amd64` or `armvf` or `powerpc`
  * `--force-session=<TYPE>` = Simulate a specific type of session where Welcome is accessed.
    * `live` (Live Session) or `guest` (Guest User) or `pi` (Raspberry Pi 2) or `vbox` (VirtualBox)

  * `--force-net` = Simulate an internet connection.
  * `--locale` = specify a locale to use, otherwise the default locale will be used.
    * If testing translations, run `./edgar-allan translate-all` first.

# Translations

## Developers

When you need to update translations do the following.

  tx pull -a
  ./welcome-po.py --update-pos
  ./edgar-allan create-all-pots
  ./edgar-allan translate-all
  tx push -s

## Translators

If you are looking to translate the software, look in
the folders `po/` and `data/po` for PO and POT files.

 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Find an existing `.po` file to edit that language's translation
 or a `.pot` file to create a new one.
 3. Translate the strings. `poedit` is recommended.
 4. Push your changes and initiate a pull request here.

A complete guide has been written at the Ubuntu MATE Community:

 * https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/guide-how-to-translate-ubuntu-mate-welcome/4234

## Preview in another locale.

Navigate to your repository folder.

    ./edgar-allan translate-all
    ./ubuntu-mate-welcome --locale=<CODE>

Use the verbose flag (`-v`) for more detailed output on which
pages will use the translated version.

Currently, Welcome still uses English for:

  * Software Boutique - Names and descriptions for applications.
  * Terminal debug output.
  * Screenshots.

## edgar-allan

Stupid name, but we like it, which supports the following arguments:

  * `create-all-pots` - will create a `.pot` file for every slide (using
  `@zwnj;` chars to denote translatable string) and place it in `data/po/<slide name>`
  * `translate-all` - for each slide, will produce translated html for
  each `.po` found in `data/po/slidename`. The `.po` should according to
  locale e.g. `en_GB.po`. The output will be written to the
  `i18n/<locale>/` directory as `slide_name.html`
  * `create-pot` - create a single `.pot` file (mainly for testing purposes)
  * `translate` - translate a single slide (mainly for testing purposes)
  * `po` - for each translatable string in a po file, set the
  translation to be the original string reversed (only for use when
  testing...)

Addtional arguments:

  * `--input=<filename>` used with `create-pot` and translate and
  specifies the source html. Also used with `po` to specified `.po` file
  containing strings to be reversed `--po-file=<filename>` used with
  `translate` and specified `.po` file to use
  * `--output=<filename>` used with `create-pot`, `translate` and `po`
  and specifies the output file

Normal usage would be to:

  * run `create-pot` to create an initial set of `.pot` files or to
  update them when new strings are added to slides.
  * check the .pots in `poedit` or a text editor in case missing or
  misaligned `&zwnj;`'s in the html
  * copy `.po` files translations from Transiflex into the
  `data/po/<slide_name>/` directories
  * run `translate-all` to build a set of translated slides

## create-test-pos.sh

For testing purposes only. After `edgar-allan create-all-pots` has been
run, this can be used to generate test `en_GB` and `fr_FR` .po files for
each slide. The `en_GB` version contains no translations whilst the
French version has every translation set as the reverse of the original
string. Translated html can be produced from these .po files by running
`edgar-allan translate-all`, and viewed in the `i18n/en_GB` and `fr_FR`
directories.

# Building a local package

If you want to build a local package for testing then do the following:

    sudo apt-get install python3-polib
    ./welcome-po.py --update-pos
    ./welcome-po.py --install
    ./edgar-allan translate-all
    debuild -b

The resulting `.deb` can be installed with
`sudo apt-get install ./ubuntu-mate-welcome.deb`.
